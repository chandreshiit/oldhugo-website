imbalance learning is the study of problems in which some classes appear more frequently than the others. Most existing works that study this problem assume data set to be dense and do not exploit the rich structure of the data. One such structure is the sparsity. In the present work, we focus on solving the class imbalance problem under the sparsity assumption. More specifically, a well-known Gmean metric for class imbalance learning problem in binary classification setting has been maximized, which results in a non-convex loss function. Convex relaxation techniques are used to convert the non-convex problem to the convex problem. The problem formulation in the present work uses L1 regularized proximal learning framework and is solved via accelerated-stochastic-proximal gradient descent algorithm. Our aim in the paper is to show: (i) the application of proximal algorithms to solve real world problems (class imbalance); (ii) how it scales to Big data; and (iii) how it outperforms some recently proposed algorithms in terms of Gmean, F-measure and Mistake rate on several benchmark data sets.","tags":["Class imbalance learning","Online learning","Proximal algorithm","Big data"],"title":"Online sparse class imbalance learning on big data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandresh Kumar Maurya","Durga Toshniwal","Gopalan Vijendran Venkoparao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651756430,"objectID":"bc726949112fc2cdd41df4f3da7f09d7","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/publication/maurya-2015-online/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T13:13:50.708424Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maurya-2015-online/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Online anomaly detection via class-imbalance learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandresh Kumar Maurya","Durga Toshniwal"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651756430,"objectID":"046541a6069b999a4966faa2c11a6f88","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/publication/maurya-2014-anomaly/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T13:13:50.333808Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maurya-2014-anomaly/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Anomaly detection in nuclear power plant data using support vector data description","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chandresh Kumar Maurya","Sonajharia Minz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651756430,"objectID":"1955b83f18da088dcd9d00d164e9f492","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/publication/maurya-2012-fuzzy/","publishdate":"2022-05-05T13:13:50.526282Z","relpermalink":"/publication/maurya-2012-fuzzy/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Fuzzy inference system for Internet traffic load forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60abaeb405147d861bb55801d25d30df","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"d2c420fc7caf2b6b5969839a6eef752d","permalink":"https://chandu8542.github.io/landing/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/landing/","section":"","summary":"hello","tags":null,"title":"Landing page","type":"widget page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Instructor: Dr. Chandresh Kumar Maurya\nLecture : Online (over Google meet, see calendar invite)\nTime : Class on Sat from 3-5 pm, Tutorial on Thu 3-4pm.

Manning and Schutze : *\u0026quot;Statistical Natural Language Processing* : MIT Press : Cambridge, MA : 1999 : 0262133601  What is this course about? Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, etc. In the last decade, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning/machine learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand basics of NLP.\nPrerequisites:  Proficiency in Python College Calculus, Linear Algebra Basic Probability and Statistics Foundations of Machine Learning  Grading policy:  Assignments\u0026ndash; There will be weekly assignments. Projects\u0026ndash; One Major that will lead to a short paper MSE ESE  Projects:  Pick a paper from ACL 2021 proceedings link. Submit a proposal in Stanford overleaf template ( link ) following the guidelines given in the template by Sat, Jan 15. You can form a team of at most 3 people (5 marks). At the end of the course, you will submit your paper in the ACL format link.
