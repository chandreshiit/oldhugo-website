Dr. Chandresh is passionate about building practical and theoretical models and  algorithms for multimodal data (Text+Image+Video+Speech). Why we need to build such a system is that we perceive and interact with our environment through many sensori organs such as eyes, ears,  mouth, etc. During his Ph.D at [IIT Roorkee, India](https://iitr.ac.in/), he worked on **Anomaly Detection in Big Data**. His Ph.D was funded by prestigious **Prime Minister Fellowship for Doctoral Research**. Post-Ph.D, he joined  **IBM Research India** as research scientist working primarily in **Natural Language Processing**. He worked there for two years and subsequently moved to Budapest, Hungary and joined **ELTE University** as a research assistant professor. He had a short stint at NIT Delhi before joining IIT Indore in July 2020.  He has also worked with **Microsoft India R&D** and **Bosch Research Center, Bangalore**.
