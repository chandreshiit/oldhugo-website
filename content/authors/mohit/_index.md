Tyler has loved creating software since he was 13 years old. He helped Chris with visualization code in iBioSim. After graduation he founded Ever Accountable, a company that creates software to help people avoid and overcome pornography. He now leads a team of people at Ever Accountable who push the boundaries of technology and psychology to make pornography avoidance and recovery as easy as possible.
